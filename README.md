 a system that integrates Gemini, Airtable, and Tana to track daily energy levels and productivity involves several steps. Below is a high-level overview of how you can set up this system:
Step 1: Set Up Airtable

    Create an Airtable Base:
        Go to Airtable and create a new base.
        Create tables for Energy Levels, Tasks, and Daily Reports.

    Define Fields:
        Energy Levels Table:
            Date (Date field)
            Energy Level (Number field, scale of 1-10)
            Notes (Text field)
        Tasks Table:
            Task Name (Text field)
            Date (Date field)
            Focus Level (Number field, scale of 1-10)
            Task Impact (Number field, scale of 1-10)
            Notes (Text field)
        Daily Reports Table:
            Date (Date field)
            Average Energy Level (Number field)
            Average Focus Level (Number field)
            Average Task Impact (Number field)
            Insights (Text field)
            Recommendations (Text field)

Step 2: Set Up Tana

    Create a Tana Workspace:
        Go to Tana and create a new workspace.
        Set up sections for Energy Levels, Tasks, and Daily Reports.

    Define Fields:
        Similar to Airtable, define fields for Date, Energy Level, Focus Level, Task Impact, and Notes.

Step 3: Set Up Gemini

    Create a Gemini Workflow:
        Go to Gemini and create a new workflow.
        Use the JSON workflow provided to structure your workflow.

    Configure Webhooks:
        Set up a webhook to receive data from a form or another application where you will input your daily energy levels and task data.

Step 4: Integrate Airtable and Tana with Gemini

    Airtable Integration:
        Use Airtable's API to connect it with Gemini.
        Set up triggers in Gemini to add or update records in Airtable based on the data received from the webhook.

    Tana Integration:
        Use Tana's API to connect it with Gemini.
        Set up triggers in Gemini to add or update records in Tana based on the data received from the webhook.

Step 5: Data Parsing and Calculations

    Parse Data:
        In Gemini, create steps to parse the incoming data from the webhook.
        Structure the data to match the fields in Airtable and Tana.

    Calculate Metrics:
        Calculate average energy levels, focus levels, and task impacts.
        Generate insights and recommendations based on the calculated metrics.

Step 6: Generate Daily Reports

    Create Daily Reports:
        In Gemini, create a step to generate daily reports based on the parsed and calculated data.
        Include average energy levels, focus levels, task impacts, insights, and recommendations in the report.

    Save Daily Reports:
        Save the generated daily reports in the Daily Reports table in Airtable and the corresponding section in Tana.

Step 7: Set Up Daily Reminders

    Create Reminders:
        Use Gemini to set up daily reminders to input your energy levels and task data.
        You can use email notifications or integrate with a messaging app to send reminders.
